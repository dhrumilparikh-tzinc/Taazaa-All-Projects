"""
Celery application instance and broker/backend configuration.

Broker  — Redis (fast, ephemeral task queue).
Backend — PostgreSQL via SQLAlchemy (durable task-result storage).

task_acks_late=True    — the task message is not acknowledged until the task
                         finishes, preventing duplicate processing if the worker
                         crashes mid-run and Redis redelivers the message.
worker_prefetch_multiplier=1 — each worker fetches one task at a time, which
                               is important because process_file can be slow
                               (minutes for large audio/video files).

A daily beat schedule runs cleanup_old_uploads to delete uploaded files for
jobs that completed or permanently failed more than 7 days ago.
