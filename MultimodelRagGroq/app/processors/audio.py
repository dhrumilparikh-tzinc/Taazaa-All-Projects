"""
Audio file processor (MP3, WAV, M4A, AAC, FLAC, OGG, WEBM).

Pipeline:
  1. Groq Whisper transcription — produces timestamped segments with
     language detection.  Files larger than MAX_AUDIO_CHUNK_MB are split
     into overlapping chunks by pydub before sending to the API.
  2. SpeechBrain ECAPA-VOXCELEB diarization — clusters 1.5-second audio
     windows into speakers via AgglomerativeClustering.  The ECAPA model
     is lazy-loaded and globally cached (_ecapa_model in audio_utils).
     Returns both speaker segments and per-speaker mean ECAPA embeddings.
  3. Merge — Whisper segments are labelled with the dominant diarization
     speaker for each time range.
  4. Markdown — segments formatted as '## [Speaker N at MM:SS]' blocks.
  5. Groq LLM summary — summary, action_items, key_decisions, topics.

The speaker ECAPA embeddings (192-dim float lists) are passed through
summary['_speaker_embeddings'] so tasks.py can tag each ChromaDB chunk
with the embedding for its speaker.
